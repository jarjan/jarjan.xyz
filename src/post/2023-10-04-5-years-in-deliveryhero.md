Today marks my 5 years anniversary in Delivery Hero. It is half of my overall 10 year experience being software engineer. I want to reflect on my journey and share it with you.

## How I got there

I have wrote about it on [my older post](https://jarjan.xyz/post/jjermany/). But let me summarize it in English, since that post is in Russian.

It all started in spring 2018 when decided to move to Europe. I was a frontend developer and applied to different companies, but I didn't have any luck. Applied directly through company websites, got a lot of rejections, and was not getting any responses from most of the companies. Luckily, one of recruitment agencies reached out to me, told about web frontend software engineer position at Delivery Hero. I was interested, and agreed to apply. Had 3 interviews(last one with CTO), and after 3 weeks got an offer. Accepted it, and started my journey.

## First year

I moved to a completely new country, started to work in big tech company, using React on production for the first time, talking in English everyday, 6 month probation period, make visas and move my family to Berlin and also need to learn German. It was a lot in the beginning. But I loved the challenge, and everything was really interesting to me. Usually, onboardings happen either in the first day of the month, or in the middle. I joined on the 4th of October, and missed most of company-wide onboardings, and I was ready to work from day 1. And I did, somehow I got hardware, all necessary access to tools, and could fix some minor CSS issue which I found while browsing on of the repo, all on my first day. The next day, product manager in my squad, invited me to his desk, took marker and A2 paper, and draw huge and crazy diagram on how things work in my department. I focused so hard to not getting fired, came early, stayed late, and learn as much as possible, take more responsibilities and just be useful overall.

It was overwhelming, but also very exciting, I made it through.

## Second year

The year when global pandemic began, and we all started to work from home. At the same time I got assigned to a new team that formed from my already previous one. Again a lot to take in, everything is changing so fast. Also this is the year when I got title Senior Software Engineer. And I got it after being in the company for 1 year and 3 months. I was not really expecting it, or even really understand what senior engineers responsibility are, I just assumed that technical excellence is the main thing. By year two I was more confident that I am worthy to be working at the company and also confident of my skills, started to share knowledge I gathered, and hard work from my first year started to pay off. I was senior software engineer now. Starting to work on a new team was very challenging, a green field area, and a need to prove that product that you are building worth further investment from the company.

Thanks to my team, we did it, and we are still working on this product till this day.

## Third year

On third year, pandemic, hard working from previous years, and the thought that I am already past two years at same company made my think about my future more. I wanted to slow things down, talked to my manager and stopped taking more responsibilities. Plus our squad had a new frontend developer, I was able to delegate things and have more spare time on my plate. I got to reflect a lot about where I am right now and where I want to go in the future. I wanted a new perspective and started doing interviews. My main objective was to learn about how other companies operate, how they interview, what are the salaries. And of course, I wanted to improve my own interviweing skills, since I have seen so many people fail miserably on interviews that I did for Delivery Hero positions. I got to understand that almost all companies are more or less same. How they work, what are the challenges and the processes.

I still go to interviews from time to time, just to keep my interviewing skills sharp and to see if anything is changed in the industry.

## Fourth year

During fourth year hyper-growth was still in the swing. My initial squad of 10 people was a whole tribe with around 10 times more people. I was back from my slow year, taking more responsibilities, being active, trying to help everyone and anyone. Started to lead frontend chapter in our tribe. And in the middle of this year, I got promoted once more, wasn't expecting again. I was covering some of the responsibilities of staff engineer, expected that it will happen after year, or maybe two. I guess, I got lucky, company was still growing, I had a tenure, and I was doing some of the responsibilities of staff engineer.

Even today I do still thinking I am more like senior engineer with some extra responsibilities.

## Fifth year

On my fifth year, Delivery Hero had few rounds of layoffs, times are turbulent, nobody is sure on what future holds. Even though I have a staff engineer title now, I feel like I don't know what I am doing at all most of the times. But that has been my constant state, kinda used to it already. I am still trying to help everyone and anyone, but I am also trying to focus on myself more. I am trying to learn how to be a better leader, how to be a better mentor, how to be a better engineer.

Five years ago, I thought that software engineering is only about writing code, and now I know that it is not. It is about people, processes, and code. I am still learning how to be better at all of those things.

## ... year?

I don't know what future holds, but I am very grateful for all the opportunities that I got in Delivery Hero. I am looking forward to the next ... years.
