<p class="mb-1">
  <em class="pr-1">Can I CSS?</em> That would be a weird question to ask myself.
</p>
<p class="mb-1">
  Given my around nine years of experience, of course, I can. But lately, I feel
  more and more distant from it. So I just wanted to reflect those thoughts now
  for future me, and perhaps you.

  <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1">Golden Age of Bootstrap</h2>
  <p class="mb-1">
    When I had just graduated from uni in 2013 and started to work at a local
    startup, the title Frontend Developer was a novelty. Not many people called
    themselves like that; everyone was just a Web Developer. And yet, already,
    many Web Developers didn't like to write CSS and were delegating those tasks
    to Frontend Developers. And those who couldn't delegate CSS to anybody,
    started using Bootstrap. Which is awesome framework to get things done, but
    you are using uniquness, and bound by limitations of it. No need to write
    CSS was a huge boost for Bootstrap, which was version 3 in 2013.

      Sample website from 2013.

      >.

  <p class="mb-1">
    After a while, almost any new website started to look same. Which could be
    fine, but CSS in 2013 was already providing us so much more: flex, grid, CSS
    variables. Most of greatness of CSS was already there, or almost there.
    Instead of using them most of the products were relying on some new CSS
    framework.

  <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1">Rise of BEM</h2>
  <p class="mb-1">
    If Bootstrap&amp;co have weakened Style part of CSS(Cascading Style Sheets),
    then BEM come and almost erased Cascade from everyones memory. Nowadays,
    people(myself included) forgot to think in cascades.
